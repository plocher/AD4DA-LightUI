4x slide potentiometers for use with I2C-AD4DA.

Fixed silkscreen AGND and +5V labels.

The Light UI has 4x slide potentiometers which are used to control
LED Layout lighting color balances and levels. It is designed to
connect to my I2C-AD4DA (I2C 4x Analog to Digital and 1x Digital
to Analog) interface board with an RJ45/8 connection.
